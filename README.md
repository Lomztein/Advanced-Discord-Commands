# Advanced-Discord-Commands
An advanced Discord bot command framework based on the Discord.NET API. Originally a part of the Adminthulhu Discord Bot, it has now been extracted, cleaned up, and put into a library. This library allows for borderline turing-complete command based programming, directly in Discord!
